# Ideas and things to do #

  * A GRID component based on jqgrid. The grid should be easily configurable via some Java classes the define which column to show out of a Bean. Integration with the data access machinery of Antilia Wicket.
  * Low level form components?
  * Is it possible to do AJAX a la Wicket?
  * Hi level components that allows to easily construct CRUDS. Most CRUDS could be autogenerated out of some descriptors and entities.
